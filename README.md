#Fashion MNIST Classification using CLIP Embeddings
This project focuses on leveraging OpenAI's CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. CLIP is a neural network that understands images and text jointly, allowing it to perform various tasks without specific task-specific training.

#Project Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how CLIP embeddings can be utilized for image classification without fine-tuning the model on the Fashion MNIST dataset. This approach showcases the generalizability and transferability of CLIP's embeddings for classification tasks.

#Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the implementation)
OpenAI CLIP library
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Fashion MNIST dataset (automatically downloaded if using certain frameworks)
